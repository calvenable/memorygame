# Memory Game (JavaScript)
The classic game of repeating an ever-increasing sequence of colours

## Installation
There's no need to install this project! It's hosted at [calvenable.github.io/memorygame](https://calvenable.github.io/memorygame) where you can play it immediately.

>Alternatively, clone (or download & unzip) the repo and open the `index.html` file. This project is written in pure local `js`, `cs` and `html`.

## How to play
Click Start, watch the sequence, and click the shapes in the same order as they flashed. The sequence becomes one flash longer each time.

Keep going for as long as you can!

## Useful info
You can use the mouse (or your finger on touchscreen devices) to select the shapes.

Keyboard control is provided as an alternative: Use the Enter key to start, and the numbers 1 through 4 to select each shape. Give these a try before you press Start to make sure you understand how it works!
